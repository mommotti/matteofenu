                    After completing the <a  style={{color: "black", textDecoration: "underline"}} href="https://www.futurelearn.com/certificates/45vt4p4" target="_blank"> UX Course</a> provided by Accenture I am now able to present my primary UX skills:
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    <h2 className="design-text">01 - USER RESEARCH.</h2>
                    The first stage of UX design is all about empathizing with the target users and discovery more about them.
                    <br></br>During the course provided by Accenture, I learnt how to undertake effective user research methods. There are many ways to learn about the target users, interviews or focus groups with typical users are a great way to start gathering precious information.
                    <br></br>A good way to empathize with users is by giving them surveys and questionnaires about what they do right now and how they feel about it.
                    <br></br>Market research is another important aspect, using reports and statistics or anything else that is available.
                    <br></br>I'm currently learning more about user research, since it's the foundation of the UX design process.
                    <br></br><br></br><h2 className="design-text">02 - PSYCHOLOGY.</h2>
                    I have always been intrigued by the psychology behind people's problems and behaviours.
                    <br></br>This particular interest, plus my love for design, drove me to pursue a career in UX.
                    <br></br>I'm finding myself more and more passionate in learning more about how feelings, thoughts and actions can be improved by an amazing design.
                    <br></br>I'm a person that brainstorms a lot by nature, and knowing that a profession that embraces both beautiful designs and deep understanding of users psychology really sells this profession for me.
                    <br></br><br></br><h2 className="design-text">03 - ACTUAL DESIGN.</h2>
                    I employ a low to high fidelity approach.
                    <br></br>From information architecture to wireframes, to actual interactive prototypes.
                    <br></br>I start with pencil and paper, sticky notes, allowing myself to quickly record my thoughts and ideas on paper without any delay.
                    <br></br>When it comes to the user journey, the user needs to understand the app at ease. 
                    <br></br>For this reason, there is a need to quickly iterate over the wireframes that are not so intuitive, making them intuitive and clean.
                    <br></br>My approach to quickly re-create a part of the wireframe is to take an A4 paper and divide it into 8 equal parts. I then set an 8 minute timer, forcing myself to quickly draw each wireframe in just 1 minute each.
                    Once I'm happy with the wireframes, I translate the design into prototypes with apps such as Adobe XD, Figma or Sketch.
